Administrator View:
	•	As an administrator, you should have access to full CRUD functionality for managing student records.
	•	Design a clean and organized dashboard interface where administrators can:
	•	Create new student records with all relevant information fields.
	•	View a list of all students with options to edit or delete each record.
	•	Clicking on a student's entry should display their details in an editable form for updating.
