# Simple Full-Stack Task 

Frontend Technical Task
You need to create a user-friendly and intuitive student website interface that interacts with the backend API to perform CRUD operations on student records. The website should be designed to cater to administrators initially, with appropriate functionality and views for this role.

You need to create a user-friendly and intuitive student API that interacts with the frontend to perform CRUD operations on student records. The API should be designed to cater to administrators initially, with appropriate functionality and views for this role.
Administrator View:<br>
For the backend, you'll need to develop an API that handles the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing students. Here's an outline of what the backend needs to provide:<br>
	•	Create Student: Endpoint to create a new student record.<br>
	•	List Students: Endpoint to retrieve a list of all students.<br>
	•	Read Student: Endpoint to retrieve details of a specific student by their ID.<br>
	•	Update Student: Endpoint to update the details of an existing student.<br>
	•	Delete Student: Endpoint to delete a student record.<br>
Each of these endpoints should be RESTful and accept appropriate HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, DELETE) and respond with JSON data.<br>


 # To Run
